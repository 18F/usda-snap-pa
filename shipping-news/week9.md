# Final Shipping News 

:tada:

This is the shipping news in which we say that it has been a pleasure and an honor working with you. 

We've emailed our final recommendations document along with our revised code evaluation. We look forward to seeing you in person on Monday to go through them with you and to do some final coworking together. We are also looking forward to our final presentaion on Tuesday.

See you soon!
