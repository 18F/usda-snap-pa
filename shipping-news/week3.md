# Shipping News for Monday the 30th

### What we did this week

- We drafted our preliminary evaluation document for the SWIM code deliverables - read it [here](usda-snap-pa/evaluation1.md). We
  based this evaluation on Understandability, Documentation, Buildability, and
  Interoperability. This was drafted to begin the conversation around how to
  move forward with the code deliverables. We expect this document to grow
  throughout the engagement.
- We scheduled meetings with stakeholders for next week and put together interview
  guides for those meetings next week.
- We inventoried documentation provided by FNS and discussed the purpose behind
  each document. We found some redundancy and believe that part of our work for
  this engagement will be making recommendations for streamlining documentation
  so that it's more friendly for vendors.
- We learned more about how the user-testing was conducted for SWIM.

### Reading material
We recently talked about the benefits of writing acceptance criteria that focus on user outcomes, rather than granular tasks. Here's some reading related to that:
- [Behavior Driven Development expained on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development)
- [Dan North's Introducing BDD](https://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd/)
- [Introduction to TSS and BDD](https://cucumber.io/blog/2017/05/15/intro-to-bdd-and-tdd) from [Cucumber.io](cucumber.io)

Additionally, we are including an article that introduces Twelve-Factor Apps, a methodology drafted in 2011 by developers at [Heroku](heroku.com). Twelve-Factor Apps lists 12 best practices for developing web applications that are portable and resilient. While we based our preliminary codebase evaluation on four criteria, we took this methodology into account when choosing them.

### What we are planning for next week

- Meet with LaVette Sydnor who will help us understand more about Alfresco and
  practices within Office of IT (OIT).
- Meet with Matthew Horn, the Contracting Officer that was on the SWIM contract.
  We’re hoping that he’ll help us learn more about the contract structure and
  issues from a contracting perspective
- Meet with Veronica Brown, a former product manager of SWIM. We're hoping to
  learn about team's process.
