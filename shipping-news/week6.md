# Shipping News for Monday the 21st

We've just completed our sixth week on this engagement. Our focus is on getting
our final deliverables in order. We're also still involved in some research to
fill the gaps that have surfaced for us.

### What we did this week

- Held user interviews with folks at the Regional and State offices;
- Revisited the criteria and terminology for the Code Evaluation and made some
  revisions;
- Continued making progress on the Final Recommendations Document;
- Began planning for our final presentation which we anticipate will include
  higher-level stakeholders.

### What we are planning for next week

- More work on the Code Evaluation document including drafting examples related
  to the criteria;
- More work on the Final Recommendations Document which will include discussions
  around all of the work we've done so far;
- Continue to interview folks involved in the SNAP waiver process.

### Reading Materials

- Folks from our Acquisitions Chapter (including Randy Hart who sat in our user
  interview with Matt Horn) wrote a blog post on the 18F blog titled _Using
  Agile Methods to improve the RFP process_.
