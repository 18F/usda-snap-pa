# Shipping News for the week of Monday the 7th

We're half way through this engagement and we're starting to shift directions from learning and toward drafting recommednations and a decision making framework. We'll continue to have follow up questions along the way, but our vision is starting to come together. We look forward to working with you in a few days!

### What we did this week

- reviewed feedback on our v1 evaluation of the existing SWIM codebase and are making revisions
- spoke with LaVette and Veronica to learn more about how the SWIM project was managed in the past
- spoke with Matt to learn about the SWIM effort from an aquisition perspective (thanks Randy for joining us and helping us go deeper by bringing your expertise in this area)  
- began synthesizing our learnings from our research thus far, including interviews, codebase evaluation, and weekly meetings with all of us

### What we are planning for next week

- On Monday, we're planning to have multiple interviews with anticipated SWIM users (these will be with individuals who process SNAP waiver requests submitted by States); 
- We'll be in DC for in person workshopping with you on Thursday and Friday! Earlier in the week, we'll be heads down on synthesizing our user interview learnings and preparing for our workshops.
