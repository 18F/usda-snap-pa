# Shipping News for Monday the 4th

As we mentioned a few times elsewhere, we are in writing mode, preparing for our wrap up, which is a little over a week away. Here's what we worked on this week:

### What we did this week

- continued drafting of our final recommendations document
- ran and generated static code reports on the Alfresco Repository Codebase and SWIM UI code (we haven't run it on the Share UI code becuase it just contains images). Doing this helped us identify the core code of the SWIM project (where most of the functionality exists). We look forward to talking about this on Tuesday in our weekly check in.    

### What we are planning for next week

- We'll continue finishing up our final materials.
