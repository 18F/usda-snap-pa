# Shipping News for Monday the 16th

This is our Shipping News document in which we report back on our past week of
work. We ship this document to our partner on Fridays.


### What we did this week

- Kick off meeting with Michael
- Conversation with ALF team to learn more about Alfresco
- Conversation with Ambur Daley
- Introduced this project at the TTS human services workstream monthly meeting
- Started setting up our own team infrastructure. Since USDA expressed that they want to improve their documentation practices and learn more about managing this application in an agile way, we want to visibly document our progress and our team rituals so that they can can learn from us. We’ve created a github repo where they can see how we’re manage this engagement and how we’re structuring our team work
- Reading documentation from USDA
- Coworking sessions during which we brainstorm together and talk about both the technical and the process needs of our partner
- Got a local instance of Alfresco Community Edition running locally
- Received a copy of the Performance Work Statement (PWS)

### What we are planning for next week
- We have a lot of materials that we still need to review to understand the history of this project, and the stakeholders involved. So we will be reading more.
- Compiling the Java source so that we can install the Alfresco SWIM AMP into the Alfresco Community edition. Once its installed we can start evaluating the source. 
- Meeting with 18F colleagues involved in related projects: those working on agile contracting and on SNAP related projects
