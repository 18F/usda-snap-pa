**This week**

- Kick off meeting with Michael
- Conversation with ALF team to learn more about Alfresco
- Conversation with Ambur Daley
- Introduced this project at the TTS human services workstream monthly meeting
- Started setting up our own team infrastructure. Since USDA expressed that they want to improve their documentation practices and learn more about managing this application in an agile way, we want to visibly document our progress and our team rituals so that they can can learn from us. We’ve created a github repo where they can see how we’re manage this engagement and how we’re structuring our team work
- Reading documentation from USDA
- Coworking sessions during which we brainstorm together and talk about both the technical and the process needs of our partner
