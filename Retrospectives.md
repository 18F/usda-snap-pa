This document contains the ideas and action items that we discovered during our
bi-weekly retrospectives.

## 04/27/2017

### Ideas

- Activity w/ partner idea: Take documentation and look at it while clicking through the demo - what objectives is it meeting, what not? How could the docs be written to help guide this process?

### Actions

- Continue distilling documentation
- Start using GitHub Issues more to capture work, make cards of issues, use notes for discussion around the work
